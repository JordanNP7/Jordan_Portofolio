# Project 1: Predicting Timeliness of Study Time for Departement of Statistics Students, Mulawarman University
For this project, I predict the timing of student graduation by using the Naive Bayes classification method using the RStudio software. I get the accuracy of this naive Bayes classification model of 74.13%.

# Project 2: Forecasting Investment Realization in East Kalimantan
In this project I predict the Realization of Investment in East Kalimantan using the Double Moving Average (DMA) method. In this project I use 3 orders, namely 2, 4, and 6. The best order is order 6 which produces a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.77.
